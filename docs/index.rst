Welcome to Sketchgraphs' documentation!
========================================

Sketchgraph is a dataset of 15 million sketches extracted from real world CAD models intended to facilitate
research in ML-aided design and geometric program induction.
In addition to the raw data, we provide several processed datasets, an accompanying python package to work with
the data, as well as a couple of starter models which implement GNN-type strategies on a couple of example problems.
